Apparently, none of the existing hugo themes were what I wanted them to be for my new blog. Or maybe I just could not find the right one. So I took upon the courtesy of making the perfect one for my own. And thus takes the birth of Ramium that I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. Coding this theme has been very fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
